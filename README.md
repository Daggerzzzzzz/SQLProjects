# The Analysis
### 1. Highest paying roles for Data Analysts in the Philippines
```sql
SELECT job_title, job_location, com_dim.name AS company_name, salary_year_avg
FROM job_postings_fact job_post
INNER JOIN company_dim com_dim ON job_post.company_id = com_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
      AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
      AND (job_location LIKE 'Manila%' OR job_location LIKE 'Taguig%' OR job_location LIKE 'Makati%')
      AND job_country = 'Philippines'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY; 
```
- Role Variability: The "Data Analyst" role appears frequently across multiple companies, indicating its high demand in the market.
- Key Locations: Manila and Taguig are hotspots for these high-paying roles, with many companies operating in these cities.

### 2. Skills that are required for high-paying Data Analyst jobs
```sql
WITH cte_top_jobs AS(
    SELECT job_id, job_title, job_location, com_dim.name AS company_name, salary_year_avg
    FROM job_postings_fact job_post
    INNER JOIN company_dim com_dim ON job_post.company_id = com_dim.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
          AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
          AND job_location LIKE '%Philippines' 
          AND job_country = 'Philippines'
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
)
SELECT job_title, job_location, company_name, sk_dim.skills AS skill, salary_year_avg
FROM cte_top_jobs cte_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sk_job ON sk_job.job_id = cte_jobs.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim sk_dim ON sk_job.skill_id = sk_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```
- Key Skills: SQL, Python, and BigQuery are among the most sought-after skills, especially for data analysts.

           sk_dim.skill_id AS skill_id,
           sk_dim.skills AS skill_name
    FROM skills_job_dim sk_job_dim
    INNER JOIN skills_dim sk_dim ON sk_job_dim.skill_id = sk_dim.skill_id
)
SELECT MAX(cte_info.skill_id) AS skill_id, cte_info.skill_name, COUNT(job_post.job_id) AS posting_count
FROM cte_skills_info cte_info
LEFT JOIN job_postings_fact job_post ON cte_info.job_id = job_post.job_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND job_post.job_location LIKE '%Philippines' 
GROUP BY cte_info.skill_name
ORDER BY posting_count DESC;
```
- Excel Dominance: Excel tops the list with 1,945 postings, showcasing its essential role in data analysis tasks.
